    <p> Dear ${user.firstName},<p/>
	<p> You are very welcome to the Group ${groupName}. Your admission has been approved by the coordinator.<p/>
    <p> From now on, you have access to the following datasets:	
    	 <dl>
			#foreach( ${role} in ${datasetList} )
				<dt>Dataset ${role.roleName}</dt>
			#end
        </dl>
    </p>
   <p> Please note that when the policy of a dataset is updated/modified or a new dataset is added to the group, you will need to explicitly accept the new policies to start using the data (an email with instructions will be sent in that case). 
	This will not affect the unaltered datasets within the group, since policies are related to the datasets, not to the group.</p>
    <p> Best regards, </p>
    <p> UDG Manager <br/>
